                <h1>Audimus Mission</h1>
                <p>The Audimus Mission is managed by the RMC Space Science Department.
                    Its goal is to design a 3U CubeSat in-house to serve as a proof of
                    concept for space-based Arctic surveillance. The satellite will be
                    placed into a low-Earth orbit at an altitude between 500 and 600
                    kilometres above sea level, resulting in an orbital period of
                    approximately 90 minutes. The CubeSat will receive and store data
                    from a sonobuoy deployed in the Lancaster Sound area[2], then
                    downlink the data to a ground station located at RMC Kingston. The
                    project is partially supported by DRDC and is being developed in
                    parallel with CSA’s CUBICS program[3]. The mission is scheduled for
                    launch in October 2026. Historically, waterways in the Arctic have
                    been restricted by ice, preventing the passage of large vessels. As
                    the polar climate warms, some channels are opening, creating both
                    scientific and strategic interest. In particular, the opening of
                    Canadian waters to potential adversaries raises a defence concern.
                    One method to monitor and study these waterways is the deployment
                    of sonobuoys, which collect data using hydrophones and transmit it
                    via VHF monopole antennas. At this stage, the data is primarily
                    valuable for scientific purposes; the military benefit is derived
                    from a successful proof of concept. The Audimus mission aims to relay
                    this data via satellite to RMC Kingston, where infrastructure exists
                    for storage, analysis, and distribution. The significant latitude
                    difference between the sonobuoy deployment zones and RMC Kingston
                    makes direct land-based communication impossible. To bridge this gap,
                    the mission will launch a CubeSat to act as a relay. Using the selected
                    technology, the CubeSat will operate in a store-and-forward pattern,
                    storing hydrophone data for four to five passes and downlinking it during
                    subsequent passes.</p>

                <p>
                    Two RMC capstone projects from the 2025 Academic year have completed work that
                    will influence the functional requirements for this project. Work on the Audimus
                    ground station was initiated by a previous undergraduate group. Their capstone
                    project brought the ground station to a functional state, enabling it to receive
                    data from a separate radio and transmit commands. However, several features
                    intended for the ground station have not yet been implemented. These features are
                    detailed in Section 8.2 of the previous group's Detailed Design Document[3] and
                    are as follows: The previous solution did not specify a protocol for radio
                    communications between the ground station and the satellite. Instead, it used the
                    amateur radio protocol, Amateur X.25 (AX.25), as a placeholder. Since the
                    completion of the previous capstone project, the Audimus Project has acquired a
                    Software Defined Radio (SDR) intended for communication with the satellite. In the
                    event of a power loss to the ground station, an auxiliary power source should
                    maintain system operation for the duration of a satellite pass. This will allow
                    the ground station to receive any remaining data and shut down safely. Remote
                    Access Notification: If an error occurs during autonomous operation, the ground
                    station should be capable of sending a notification to an external computer. This
                    will enable an operator to address the issue promptly and minimize data loss.
                    Currently, ground station settings are configured by modifying a file on the
                    computer. A settings tab within the ground station GUI should allow users to
                    modify settings while the application is running. At the time of writing, a
                    rotator upgrade has rendered the satellite tracking module of their solution
                    non-functional. For the ground station to fulfill its intended purpose, it must
                    be capable of communicating with the satellite’s onboard computer operating system.
                    Previous work on the Audimus Relay-Operating System (AR-OS) used the Amateur X.25
                    (AX.25) communication protocol as a placeholder for the data link layer. At the
                    time of writing, no solution exists to manage or organize data transmission
                    between the satellite and the ground station.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the progress made by previous capstone projects, several critical aspects
                    of the Audimus ground station remain incomplete. These gaps prevent the system
                    from achieving full operational capability and meeting the mission’s objectives.
                    Addressing these deficiencies constitutes the solutions gap that later projects
                    must close. The ground station must be capable of uplinking commands to the AR-OS
                    and downlinking sonobuoy data. Both the ground station and the AR-OS currently use
                    placeholders for their radio communications. A defined set of protocols is required
                    to ensure the safe and reliable transmission of data between the ground station
                    SDR and the CubeSat. The Audimus Satellite’s current trajectory results in more
                    passes over the Arctic sonobuoy than over RMC. Additionally, passes over RMC must
                    accommodate the transmission of satellite commands, health data, and mission data.
                    Together, these factors indicate that downlinking will likely be the bottleneck in
                    data relay, requiring special considerations to maximize throughput. As part of
                    this protocol, uplink commands must be encrypted to prevent unauthorized control
                    of the satellite. It should also be noted that broadcasting at the frequency and
                    power levels used by the ground station radio is regulated by law. A trained radio
                    operator is required during uplink operations, whereas no operator is needed for
                    downlink reception. There is currently no solution to share the Sonobuoy Data
                    beyond the ground station computer once it reaches RMC. Some solution is required
                    to share that data with interested parties. At present, no solution enables
                    either the ground station or the AR-OS to communicate via their respective SDRs.
                    Currently, the ground station relies on a manually tuned audio transmitter to
                    test the transmission frontend, which serves only as a placeholder. The final
                    solution will employ an SDR that is automatically controlled by the ground
                    station computer; this SDR has been procured but not yet implemented. Similarly,
                    the AR-OS has only been tested using simulated communications, and no effort has
                    been made to interface it with its intended SDR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our project will provide interfacing software which will allow the existing ground
                    station computer to use the SDR to send and receive messages, encapsulated in
                    datagrams formatted based on a suitable protocol. Any data received should be
                    accessible on a human-readable and remote interface. In broad terms, the scope
                    of this project is all tasks related to the downlinking and handling of sonobuoy
                    data. This task can be broken into six broad categories relating to some aspects
                    of the solutions gap. The ground station rotator is currently non-functional due
                    to the existing code. Updating this code is necessary for proper ground station
                    operation and falls within the scope of this project. Several planned features
                    for the ground station remain unfinished. These features were part of the Audimus
                    Mission's original design for the ground station and are included within the
                    scope of this project. The unreliable nature of CubeSat radio connections,
                    combined with the downlink bottleneck, creates the need for a protocol that
                    ensures reliable and efficient communications. The Audimus project has acquired
                    an SDR intended for communication with the satellite. An interface is required
                    between the ground station computer and this SDR. This interface will manage the
                    serialization and deserialization of data, as well as the direct transmission of
                    commands to the SDR. It should be noted that the AR-OS SDR interface is not within
                    the scope of this project. However, for the sake of the Audimus mission, we should
                    build our system with the SDR to AR-OS interface in mind. There is a need to
                    disseminate satellite data to ensure its availability to interested parties.
                    Ideally, this data should be accessible over the internet. However, security and
                    permissions constraints may limit external access. As a result, the development
                    of a web application for data sharing is within the project’s scope. But, enabling
                    internet access to this application is considered optional. Since the satellite
                    launch will occur outside the time span of this project, communications testing
                    will require a simulation between the ground station SDR and another SDR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end state, our project will facilitate the transfer of data from the CubeSat
                    to the existing ground station computer. The ground station will be capable of
                    interfacing with the SDR to send and receive messages to the CubeSat. The ground
                    station will be updated to include the features originally intended by the
                    previous project. A web server will provide data access to interested stakeholders.
