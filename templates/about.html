                        The Audimus Mission is managed by the RMC Space Science Department. Its goal is to design a
                        3U CubeSat in-house to serve as a proof of concept for space-based Arctic surveillance. The
                        satellite will be placed into a low-Earth orbit at an altitude between 500 and 600 kilometres above
                        sea level, resulting in an orbital period of approximately 90 minutes. The CubeSat will receive and
                        store data from a sonobuoy deployed in the Lancaster Sound area, then downlink the data to a
                        ground station located at RMC Kingston. The project is partially supported by DRDC and is being
                        developed in parallel with CSA's CUBICS program. The mission is scheduled for launch in
                        October 2026.

                        Historically, waterways in the Arctic have been restricted by ice, preventing the passage of large
                        vessels. As the polar climate warms, some channels are opening, creating both scientific and
                        strategic interest. In particular, the opening of Canadian waters to potential adversaries raises a
                        defence concern. One method to monitor and study these waterways is the deployment of
                        sonobuoys, which collect data using hydrophones and transmit it via VHF monopole antennas. At
                        this stage, the data is primarily valuable for scientific purposes; the military benefit is derived from
                        a successful proof of concept.

                        The Audimus mission aims to relay this data via satellite to RMC Kingston, where infrastructure
                        for processing, storing, and visualizing the data is being developed by the RMC Software Engineering group.
